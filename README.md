# cse_public

This is the low-level layer of my personal game engine, written C++ and GLSL.  This is not provided to the public for use (there are several missing dependencies needed to compile), but merely as a showcase of my programming style in C++.

## TODO
NOTE:  There's some weird formatting that snuck in somehow, probably from me opening this on another macbook pro without my tabs properly set.  Will have to sync this with the current engine version with all that grossness cleaned up.
